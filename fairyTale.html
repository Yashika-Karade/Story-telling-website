            <textarea id="area1">Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named Cinderella. She was a kind, gentle, and beautiful child with the most radiant smile. Cinderella had a heart full of love, but unfortunately, fate hadn't been kind to Cinderella. Her mother had passed away, leaving her alone with her selfish stepmother.

                The stepmother had two daughters of her own, and she was terribly jealous of Cinderella's beauty and kind heart. She treated Cinderella unfairly, making her do all the housework and dress in rags while her own daughters wore fine clothes and lived in luxury.
                
                Despite the cruelty she faced, Cinderella remained kind and gentle, never letting her stepmother's unkindness change who she was. She would often seek comfort in the garden, talking to the birds and the animals, who had become her dearest friends.
                
                One day, the kingdom received exciting news. The prince was hosting a grand ball at the palace, and every maiden in the land was invited. Cinderella's stepsisters were overjoyed and spent weeks preparing their gowns and practicing their dance moves.
                
                Cinderella watched her stepsisters with a sad smile, hoping she might be able to attend the ball and experience a bit of the magic she had heard about in her mother's stories. But her stepmother was insistent that Cinderella would stay home and continue with her chores.
                
                The night of the ball arrived, and Cinderella was left alone in her old clothes while her stepsisters and stepmother departed for the palace. She sat by the fireplace, tears in her eyes, wishing for just a taste of the magic her mother had told her about.
                
                Suddenly, a soft, sweet voice filled the room. It was her fairy godmother, a beautiful figure surrounded by a soft, glowing light.
                
                "Why are you crying, my dear?" the fairy godmother asked.
                
                Cinderella explained her wish to attend the ball but how her stepmother had been unkind and refused to allow her to go.
                
                The fairy godmother smiled and said, "Don't worry, my child. You shall go to the ball."
                
                With a wave of her wand, Cinderella's rags were transformed into a stunning gown, and on her feet, she wore the most delicate glass slippers that sparkled like stars. Her fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage and mice into beautiful horses, so Cinderella could travel to the palace in style.
                
                Before she left, the fairy godmother gave Cinderella a piece of advice: "Remember, my dear, the magic will only last until midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, you must leave the palace and return home."
                
                Cinderella thanked her fairy godmother and climbed into the magical carriage. As she arrived at the palace, she felt like a princess, her heart dancing with joy.
                
                The moment Cinderella entered the ballroom, the entire room fell silent. The prince, charmed by her beauty, approached her, and they danced together like a dream. Cinderella was the happiest she had ever been.
                
                But as the hours flew by, she suddenly heard the bells of the palace clock. The first stroke of midnight sent a shiver down her spine. She remembered her fairy godmother's warning and knew she must leave.
                
                Cinderella hurriedly said goodbye to the prince and fled from the palace. As she ran down the grand staircase, one of her glass slippers slipped off her foot. She didn't have time to retrieve it, and so, with only one glass slipper, she disappeared into the night.
                
                Cinderella's beautiful gown and glass slippers turned back into rags, leaving her with only the memory of the enchanting evening she had spent at the palace.
                
                The next day, the prince was determined to find the owner of the glass slipper. He and his attendants traveled throughout the kingdom, visiting every home to see if the slipper would fit any young maiden.
                
                When they arrived at Cinderella's cottage, her stepsisters eagerly tried to fit their feet into the glass slipper. But it was too small for them, and their feet simply couldn't squeeze in.
                
                Cinderella watched, hidden from view, as her stepsisters attempted to trick the prince. Then, she stepped forward and, with a hopeful heart, asked, "May I try?"
                
                The prince agreed, and as she placed her foot into the glass slipper, it fit perfectly. The prince's eyes lit up with joy as he realized he had found the maiden he had danced with at the ball.
                
                Cinderella's stepsisters were astonished and upset. But even though they were mean to her, Cinderella didn't feel angry. Instead, she forgave them for their unkindness, as she believed that kindness was the most important thing in the world.
                
                And so, Cinderella was reunited with the prince, and they lived happily ever after, proving that goodness, kindness, and a loving heart could overcome the challenges life may bring.
            


            Moral of the Story:
            Being kind and having a loving heart can help you through tough times. Even though Cinderella faced meanness and hard work, she stayed kind and gentle, and her goodness led to her happiness and success. The story also shows the importance of forgiveness, as Cinderella forgave her stepsisters, teaching us that being kind and forgiving are very important.

        <h2>Jack And The Beanstalk</h2>

        Down in the valley was a village. 
            On the outskirts of the village stood a small, rundown cottage. And in the cottage lived a widow with her only son, Jack.
            They were poor.
            This was clear to see from the ragged clothes on their backs and the worn shoes on their feet. But, as the story goes, they did possess one item of real value—a gorgeous, caramel coloured cow.

         Jack woke early every morning.

            He milked the cow, poured the milk into a jug and set off to the dairy. The milk was only worth a few pennies, but Jack didn’t mind. He happily accepted the pennies from a local cheese maker, bought a few potatoes from the market and returned home.
            
            Jack did this everyday. The milk from the cow was just enough to help Jack and his mother get by.
            
            One year a terribly harsh winter hit the village.
            
            Great howling winds blew and the snow lay in huge drifts—never before seen by the villagers.
            
            The following spring the grass did not grow.
            
            Without grass the cow had nothing to eat and soon became too weak to produce milk.
            
            “Mother!” cried Jack, “I cannot get a single drop of milk from our dear cow this morning.”
            
            Jack worried holding empty milk bottle in air
            
            “Alas,” the widow replied, “I feared this day would come and so it has. Jack, my dear boy, it's time to sell our precious cow. Take her to the market and auction her to the highest bidder.”
            
            Jack looked sad.
            
            “But mother,” he said, “without our daily milk from the cow we'll soon run out of money and then what will we do?”
            “Don’t worry, Jack, we’ll think of something,” she replied.
            
            Jack set off down to the village with the cow.
            
            Before he reached the market he came across a friendly butcher. The butcher wore a blue and white striped apron, a straw hat and carried a small, green drawstring bag.
            The butcher approached Jack.
            
            Butcher in striped apron holding green small bag patting cow Jack watching 
            
            “Eh, what a fine cow you have there young man,” he said, patting the cow firmly.
            
            “I’m selling her,” replied Jack.
            
            “Are you indeed?”
            
            “Yes,” said Jack, “my mother told me to go to the market and only sell her to the highest bidder for she is extremely valuable.”
            
            “I can see that,” replied the butcher.
            
            “That is why,” he continued, “I'm going to give you a once in a lifetime offer. An offer worth no less than a thousand times what you will receive from anyone else at the market.”
            
            Jack looked up at the butcher in awe.
            
            “What is this offer?” asked Jack.
            
            “Magic beans,” said the butcher, stepping forward and opening the little green pouch.
            
            Jack peered inside.
            <br>
            
            Jack looking at magic beans in Butcher's hand
            
            “Three beans?” he snorted.
            
            “Three magic beans,” replied the butcher, “that will most certainly change your—and your dear mother’s—life for the better.”
            
            Jack reflected for a moment.
            
            “A thousand times more valuable,” he thought to himself, “and something that will help my mother.”
            
            “Very well,” said Jack.
            
            He exchanged the cow for the little pouch—containing the three magic beans— and returned home.
            
            Jack told his mother of the butcher and the beans, and then watched in horror as her ashen face turned puce.
            
            Jack holding magic beans in green bag showing shocked angry mother
            
            “You’ve done what?” she bellowed.
            
            “Bu...bu...bu...but, mother,” stammered Jack, “the man said they were magic beans and… a a a and… they would help us…a a a and…”
            
            He stopped before he could finish the sentence.
            
            Even Jack—now hearing these words coming out of his own mouth for the first time—could not believe what he was saying. It sounded ridiculous. And he suddenly felt overwhelmed with shame.
            
            He began to sob.
        
            
            “Oh, mother,” he cried, “I’m so sorry. I can’t believe I have done something so silly. Can you ever forgive me?”
            
            “Go to your room, Jack,” she said, “you must think long and hard about what you've done.”
            
            Still clasping the little pouch of beans, Jack turned, trudged upstairs to his bedroom and closed the door.
            
            He tipped the beans into his palm and then sat on the edge of his bed staring at them.
            
            Jack sad looking studying the magic beans in his hand
            
            “How could I have been so stupid!” he said to himself, angrily.
            
            “I mean… look at them! Three blinking, measly little beans in exchange for a whole cow? What was I thinking?”
            
            In a fit of rage, he clenched his fist and tossed the beans out of the window. Then curled up on the bed and fell into a deep sleep.
            
            When Jack awoke it was morning.
            
            This particular morning was bright and sunny. Which was strange because the sun did not stream through Jack’s bedroom window as it usually would. On this particular morning, his room remained dark.
            
            Jack ran to the window.
            
            What met his stare took his breath away. 
            
            A giant beanstalk rose like ten mighty oaks, high up into the sky.
            
            Jack surprised looking out the window at huge green beanstalk in sky clouds visible
            
            “They were magic beans,” Jack exclaimed, “perhaps..perhaps they do hold the great riches that the butcher speaks of?”
            
            That was it.
            
            Without a second thought, Jack jumped out of his bedroom window and onto the giant beanstalk.
            
            Great, leafy vines snaked around like ladders—making it ever so easy for Jack to scale the skyscraping stalk.
            
            He began to climb.
            
            Higher.
            
            And higher.
            
            And higher.
            
            Not stopping for a moment to look down. This is probably just as well for Jack was now so high up that his cottage, the village and all of the surrounding lands could be seen no more.
            
            Suddenly, came a shrill voice.
            
            “Jack, is that you?” it said.
            
            “Yes,” said Jack.
            
            A tiny, beautiful fairy appeared—and hovered in the air, just a few inches from the tip of Jack’s nose.
            
            Jack climbing up the beanstalk fairy hoovering in air
            
            “I’ve been waiting many years to see you, Jack,” said the fairy, “as I have a very important secret to tell you.”
            
            Jack looked surprised.
            
            “Oh…” he said.
            
            “You see, Jack,” continued the fairy, “your father was once a very wealthy man.”
            
            “My father's dead,” said Jack.
            
            “Yes,” said the fairy, “but don’t you want to know how he died?”
            
            “Mother said he was sick,”
            
            “Oh my darling, Jack,” said the fairy, “your mother wanted to protect you. Your father was not sick. He was known across many kingdoms for he owned the most rare and magnificent of all creatures—a mystical golden hen that laid a golden egg every day.”
            
            Golden hen laying a gold egg
            
            Jack was dumbfounded.
            
            “So… how did he die?” he asked.
            
            The fairy—still hovering daintily in front of him—raised her arm and pointed into the distance.
            
            “See that castle. Well, in that castle lives a Giant. And it is this beastly tyrant that ate your father and stole his golden hen. You must avenge him, Jack, and take back what is rightly yours.” 
            
            But before Jack could reply, she vanished.
            
            Jack took a moment to gather himself and then set off towards the castle. And—before long—the colossal structure towered before him.
            
            Jack had never seen a building so big.
            
            The steps leading up to the front door were taller than he was. The front door itself was as big as a mighty oak. And astride the door—staring menacingly back at him—stood the statues of two gigantic stone lions.
            
            Jack took a deep breath.
            
            Then—without further ado—he lay flat on the ground and rolled under the front door.
            
            Jack lying flat on the floor in front of giant's castle door
            
            Jack stood up and dusted himself down.
            
            He looked around slowly, trying to take in the enormity of his surroundings.
            
            Huge, intricately carved wooden doors lined the hallway in front of him. And a rug—the length of a dozen London buses—lay upon the cold stone floor. It was quite something to behold.
            
            And then all of a sudden the ground began to tremor—followed by the sound of almighty footsteps.
            
            Thud.
            
            Thud.
            
            Thud.
            <br>
            
            Suddenly, a door crashed open.
            
            The Giant appeared momentarily with the golden hen clenched firmly in the palm of his hand. Without stopping, he marched forward and flung open the kitchen door.
            
            Big hairy giant in underwear striding holding golden hen 
            
            Jack darted across the hallway —making sure not to be seen—followed the Giant into the kitchen.
            
            “Where’s my dinner?’” bellowed the Giant.
            
            “It’s coming dear,” said his wife.
            
            The Giant sat down at the kitchen table and carefully placed the golden hen out in front of him.
            
            Jack quickly snuck behind a table leg.
            
            “Oh I do wish you wouldn’t put that thing on the dinner table” said his wife, laying an enormous bowl of steaming stew in front of the Giant.
            
            The Giant glared at her.
            
            “That thing is my golden hen” boomed the Giant, “and she's due to lay her daily golden egg at any mo…”
            
            He stopped.
            
            Then—looking around very slowly—the Giant raised his nose into the air, sniffed and then hollered,
            
            “Fee… fie… fo… fum,
            I smell the blood of an Englishman”
            
            Big giant sitting at table smelling the blood of an Englishman golden hen on table Jack hiding under table
            
            “Don’t be silly, dear,” said his wife, “you haven’t eaten a human since the day you stole that wretched hen.”
            
            “I can smell him!” he roared.
            
            “Eat your dinner, dear,” she replied calmly, “before it gets cold.”
            
            The Giant ate his stew and then—without a moment’s warning—his head hit the table and he fell fast asleep.
            
            “This is my chance,” thought Jack.
            
            He quickly shimmied up the table leg, grabbed the tablecloth and hauled himself up. Then—hardly daring to breathe for fear of waking the Giant—he crept forward across the table top, carefully placed the golden hen under his arm and made a beeline for the open window at the end of the table.
            
            “By jove… I’ve done it!” he thought.
            
            Then—to Jack’s horror—came an almighty scream from the Giant’s wife.
            
            “AHHHHH… A… A… A… A BOY!” she cried.
            
            The Giant awoke with a start, enraged by what he had heard.
            
            “Where?” he roared.
            
            “There!” screamed his wife, pointing at Jack—who was now sprinting at top speed towards the window— “and he's got your golden hen!”
            
            The Giant made a lunge for Jack.
            
            Jack scared running away from giant holding the golden hen
            
            But it was too late.
            
            Jack escaped through the open window and made it back down the beanstalk to safety.
            
            ~~~
            
            After returning to the ground, Jack cut down the magical beanstalk and neither the Giant, nor his wife, were ever seen again. And, true to the fairy’s word, the hen laid one golden egg each day. 
            
            Golden hen and golden egg sitting
            
            Before long, Jack and his mother had enough money to buy a new cow and I am pleased to say that—from that day forward—they lived a long, happy and prosperous life together.

        <h1>Little Red Riding Hood</h1>
        <img src="https://www.readthetale.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-4.jpg">
        <textarea id="area3">Once upon a time, in a small village in the middle of a big forest, lived a sweet little girl named Little Red Riding Hood. She got her name from the red hooded cloak her grandmother had made for her. Little Red loved to visit her grandmother, who lived on the other side of the woods.

            One sunny morning, her mother packed a basket with freshly baked goodies and a jar of honey for her grandmother. “Be careful, my dear,” her mother said. “Stay on the path and don’t talk to strangers.”
            
            Little Red promised to listen to her mother and set off on her journey with a skip in her step. She hummed a happy tune as she walked along the winding path through the magical forest.

Little Red didn’t know that a sneaky wolf was watching her from the shadows. The wolf wanted the delicious treats she was carrying and came up with a plan to trick her.

“Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood,” the wolf said, pretending to be friendly. “Where are you going with such a lovely basket?”

“Oh, good morning, Mr. Wolf,” Little Red replied politely. “I’m going to visit my grandmother. She’s not feeling well, and I’m bringing her some goodies to make her feel better.”

The wolf’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “That’s very kind of you. But don’t you think it would be nice to pick some flowers for your grandmother from the meadow over there? I’m sure she would love them.”

Little Red thought it was a good idea and went into the meadow to pick some flowers. The wolf quickly ran to her grandmother’s cottage, hoping to get there before her.

When he arrived at the cottage, the wolf found the grandmother resting in bed. He quickly locked her in the closet and put on her nightcap and glasses, pretending to be her.

Meanwhile, Little Red finished picking flowers and arrived at her grandmother’s cottage. Knocking on the door, she called out, “Grandma, it’s me, Little Red Riding Hood. I’ve brought you some treats.”

The wolf replied in a disguised voice, “Come in, my dear.”

As Little Red entered the cottage, she noticed that her grandmother looked different. “Grandma, what big eyes you have,” she said, feeling suspicious.

“The better to see you with, my dear,” the wolf replied, trying to sound like the grandmother.

Little Red noticed other changes too. “Grandma, what big ears you have,” she said.

“The better to hear you with, my dear,” the wolf replied, trying to hide his excitement.

Finally, Little Red noticed the sharp teeth. “Grandma, what big teeth you have,” she said, now sure that something was wrong.

“The better to eat you with!” the wolf shouted, throwing off the disguise and showing his true self.

Terrified, Little Red ran to the door, but just as the wolf jumped towards her, a brave woodsman burst into the cottage. He had heard the noise and hurried to save Little Red and her grandmother.

With a mighty swing of his axe, the woodsman scared the wolf away. Little Red and her grandmother were safe.

From that day on, Little Red Riding Hood learned an important lesson about being careful and never talking to strangers. She thanked the brave woodsman for saving her and promised to be more careful in the future.

        <h2>The Ugly Duckling</h2>
        <img src="https://www.readthetale.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bedtime-Story-The-Ugly-Duckling-1.jpg">
        <textarea id="area4">Once upon a time, in a quiet pond with tall plants and pretty flowers around it, a mother duck waited excitedly for her eggs to hatch. Finally, the day came when one egg cracked open, and out came a tiny, grayish duckling. Even though the mother duck loved all her babies, she noticed that this little one looked different from the rest.

            “My dear, you may not be as pretty as your siblings, but you are just as special,” she said, giving the duckling lots of love.But as the days passed, the little duckling noticed that the other ducklings made fun of him because he looked different. Feeling sad and alone, he decided to leave the pond and find a place where he could belong.

            He traveled through fields and woods, hoping to find friends who would accept him for who he was. Along the way, he met other animals who wondered about his different look.
            
            “You don’t look like us,” said the rabbits.
            
            “Why are you so gray?” asked the bluebirds.
            
            The little duckling felt sad with every question, but he kept going, hoping to find his real home.
            
            As autumn came, he found a beautiful lake shining in the sunlight. There, he saw a group of beautiful swans swimming on the water, their wings shining like silver.
            
            Enchanted by their beauty, the little duckling went to them. But as he got closer, he was unsure, remembering how he had been treated before. He was afraid the swans would not want him too.
            
            To his surprise, the swans welcomed him. “Hello there, little friend. You are welcome to join us,” said the kindest swan.
            
            “But I’m not beautiful like you. I’m just an ugly duckling,” he said with a bit of sadness.
            
            The kind swan smiled. “You may think that now, but beauty is not just about looks. It’s about being kind, brave, and true to yourself. Come, let us be friends.”
            
            With new hope and happiness, the little duckling joined his new friends. As time passed, he felt a feeling of fitting in he had never felt before. He swam with the swans, played games, and laughed under the moon.
            
            One morning, as he looked at his reflection in the lake, he saw a beautiful creature staring back at him. His once dull feathers had turned white, and he realized that he had grown into a beautiful swan, just like his new friends.
            
            From that day on, the little duckling was no longer the “Ugly Duckling.” He had become a brave and graceful swan, ready to face any challenge that came his way. And he knew that true beauty was inside.

        <h1>The Golden Bird</h1>
        <img src="https://www.readthetale.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/golden-bird.jpg">
        <textarea id="area5">
            Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a wise and kind king who had an amazing golden apple tree. Every night, the apples from this tree disappeared, leaving the king confused and sad. Determined to catch the thief, the king told his three sons to guard the tree.

The oldest son took the first watch, but he quickly grew tired and fell asleep. The same happened with the second son. However, when it was the youngest son’s turn, he promised to stay awake.As the night grew darker, the youngest son heard the flutter of wings and saw a beautiful golden bird perched on the tree. With the help of a clever talking fox, he made a plan to capture the bird.

Together, they went on an exciting adventure, facing many difficulties along the way. They crossed dangerous rivers, climbed tall mountains, and went into dark forests. But through it all, the youngest son remained brave and determined.Finally, they reached the golden bird’s nest, and the youngest son managed to catch it. The bird begged for its freedom, promising to give him great rewards if he let it go.

But the youngest son remembered his promise to his father and did not change his mind because of the bird’s promises. With the golden bird in hand, he returned to the land, where the king welcomed him as a hero.

However, the king’s demands did not end there. He sent his youngest son on even more brave quests, including getting a magical golden horse and rescuing a beautiful maiden from a magic castle.With the help of his loyal friend, the talking fox, the youngest son completed each task successfully. And in the end, he not only saved the land but also proved himself worthy to be the next king.

As the youngest son moved into his new role, he never forgot the lessons he learned on his adventurous journey – the importance of bravery, kindness, and staying true to oneself. And every night, as he drifted off to sleep, he would remember the exciting adventure of the golden bird and smile, knowing that he had truly become a hero.
