            <textarea id="area1">Tom was excited about his new neighbors. He'd noticed moving trucks and some boxes, but he hadn’t caught a glimpse of the new resident yet. Finally, one evening, he saw someone on the porch. Eager to make a new friend, he grabbed some cookies his mom had baked and walked over to introduce himself.

                "Hi, I'm Tom! I live next door," he said with a grin, holding out the cookies.
                
                The man on the porch looked at Tom, eyes widening in surprise. "Oh, thank goodness! You’ve brought food!" he exclaimed, grabbing a cookie like it was a lifesaver.
                
                Tom chuckled. "Rough moving day, huh?"
                
                The man sighed dramatically. "You have no idea. I didn’t know moving would be this...exhausting. My wife sent me to set things up, and she just arrives tomorrow. I tried cooking, but the only thing I managed to make was a mess!"
                
                "Well, these cookies will keep you alive at least another day," Tom joked, handing him the whole plate.
                
                The neighbor’s eyes twinkled. "Bless you, kid. If you need anything—like, say, help with your math homework or someone to check out a mysterious noise in the attic—I'm your guy. But cooking? That’s a lost cause."
                
                The two laughed, and from that moment on, Tom and his new neighbor had an unbreakable bond</textarea>

        <textarea id="area2">One day, a young man named Sam went to a magic show. He wasn't particularly interested in magic, but his friend dragged him along. Sam had always thought magic tricks were silly and, frankly, a bit dumb.

            At the show, the magician called for a volunteer from the audience. Without thinking, Sam raised his hand, thinking he would just go up there to make the show more entertaining.
            
            The magician looked at him and grinned. "Great! You’ll do perfectly!" he said, pulling Sam onto the stage.
            
            "Now," the magician said, "I'm going to make something disappear! Watch carefully."
            
            The magician waved his wand, muttered some gibberish, and then asked Sam to hold his hand out.
            
            Sam, just wanting to get this over with, reluctantly stretched his hand. The magician flicked his wrist dramatically, and suddenly, a rabbit appeared in Sam's hand. Sam jumped, dropping the bunny onto the floor.
            
            The audience erupted in laughter. "No, no, no," the magician said, rushing to collect the bunny, "This was supposed to be an illusion! You’re supposed to be the volunteer, not the star!"
            
            But Sam, now holding a rabbit in his hands, didn’t want to give it back. "What do I do with this? I don't even like rabbits!" he exclaimed.
            
            "Just hand it to me!" the magician insisted, flustered.
            
            Sam shrugged and handed the rabbit back, but then another one appeared out of nowhere.
            
            The magician, now in full panic mode, started mumbling to himself. "What is happening? This was never supposed to happen!"
            
            The audience couldn’t stop laughing as Sam stood there, bewildered, with a look that seemed to say, "Am I part of this trick now?"
            
            At that moment, the magician, red-faced and embarrassed, gave up on the trick entirely and handed Sam a bouquet of flowers. "You, my friend, are the magician now."
            
            Sam stared at the bouquet, then back at the audience. "Well, at least I didn't make rabbits appear from nowhere," he said, and everyone laughed even harder.
            
            And from that day forward, Sam was known as the accidental magician. He still didn’t know how it happened, but every time someone asked, he’d say, "It was magic!"</textarea>
